# 🐆 `calico/` — alternative CNI: pod network + NetworkPolicy, **no** LoadBalancer IPs

> The lab's third CNI choice, next to `flannel` (bare-bones) and `cilium` (the default).
> Calico is installed by the **Tigera operator** and covers the pod network, routing and
> NetworkPolicy. It does **not** take over the "cloud provider" role that Cilium fills on top:
> no `LoadBalancer` Service IP, hence no `192.168.56.200` VIP on its own — which is why
> [`../metallb/`](../metallb/README.md) is installed alongside it, automatically. Read the 🎯
> section before choosing.

## 🎯 Purpose

### What Calico does here

- **CNI**: pod network over **VXLAN** on `10.244.0.0/16`, `natOutgoing` to reach the Internet.
  It is what takes the nodes from `NotReady` to `Ready`.
- **NetworkPolicy**: the standard `networking.k8s.io/v1` ones **and** the
  `NetworkPolicy`/`GlobalNetworkPolicy` of `projectcalico.org/v3` (order, tiers, explicit `deny`,
  `HostEndpoint`…). That is the real reason this directory exists: working on micro-segmentation
  with the reference implementation.
- **`projectcalico.org/v3` API**: the `calico-apiserver` is enabled, so Calico objects are read
  and written with `kubectl`, without installing `calicoctl`.

### What Calico does not do — and why that blocks you

> ⚠️ **Calico does NOT announce `LoadBalancer` Service IPs on this lab.** It can only do it over
> **BGP** (`serviceLoadBalancerIPs` in a `BGPConfiguration`), which requires a **peer router** to
> establish a session with. On a VirtualBox host-only network, that router does not exist. And
> Calico has **no equivalent** of Cilium's L2/ARP announcement
> (`CiliumLoadBalancerIPPool` + `CiliumL2AnnouncementPolicy`). That is why `installation.yaml`
> sets `bgp: Disabled`: it is not an oversight, it is a fact.

Concrete, not theoretical consequence: with `CNI=calico` **and nothing else**,

| What happens | Visible effect |
|---|---|
| The Envoy Gateway Service never gets an external IP | `EXTERNAL-IP <pending>` |
| The `main-gateway` `Gateway` has no address | empty `status.addresses` |
| The `HTTPRoute`s are reachable by nobody | Argo CD, Grafana, Vault, Longhorn, MinIO… **unreachable** |
| The wildcard certificate is still issued (DNS-01) | but is useless: there is no entry point left |

In other words: **the whole `k8s-playground/` layer of the lab depends on that VIP.** So
`../platform-up.sh` no longer leaves you there: as soon as `CNI != cilium` it installs
[**MetalLB**](../metallb/README.md) right after this script, on the very same range and the same
interface Cilium would have used. See [🌐 Making the UIs reachable](#-making-the-lab-uis-reachable-metallb).

### Cilium or Calico?

| Capability | Cilium (`cilium/`) | Calico (this directory) |
|---|---|---|
| CNI (pod network, routing) | ✅ VXLAN, host-only NIC pinned | ✅ VXLAN, autodetection on `192.168.56.0/24` |
| Kubernetes NetworkPolicy | ✅ | ✅ |
| Extended policies | ✅ `CiliumNetworkPolicy` (L7, DNS, identities) | ✅ `projectcalico.org/v3` (tiers, order, `HostEndpoint`) |
| **L2 announcement of LoadBalancer IPs** | ✅ built in (ARP, `.200-.230` pool) | ❌ none of its own (BGP only) → [`metallb/`](../metallb/README.md), installed automatically |
| kube-proxy replacement | ✅ `kubeProxyReplacement=true` (documented) | ⚠️ only with the **eBPF** dataplane, ruled out here (see ⚠️ Pitfalls) |
| Flow observability | ✅ Hubble (relay + UI) installed | ⚠️ Whisker + Goldmane shipped by the chart, **disabled** by default here |
| Ready to use in THIS lab | ✅ `platform-up.sh` chains everything | ✅ `platform-up.sh` chains everything too, MetalLB included |

> 💡 **Recommendation: keep Cilium as the lab default.** Calico is here to *compare* CNIs and to
> work on NetworkPolicy, not to light up a complete lab without extra work.

## 📋 Prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Why | Check |
|---|---|---|
| Cluster bootstrapped **without a CNI** (`CNI=calico` in `lab.env`, then `./kubeadm/cluster-up.sh` or `./talos/cluster-up.sh`) | `kubeadm init` never installs a pod network: Calico takes that slot | `kubectl get nodes` → all `NotReady` **before** the install, that is expected |
| **No other CNI present** | two CNIs fight over `/etc/cni/net.d` and the routes; there is no clean way back | the script refuses to run if it sees a `cilium` or `flannel` DaemonSet in any namespace |
| **`KUBE_PROXY_REPLACEMENT=false`** | ⚠️ only Cilium can replace kube-proxy here. `kubeadm/cluster-up.sh` refuses the `calico` + `true` pair outright, and this script re-checks it: without kube-proxy *and* without a replacement, no ClusterIP answers at all | `kubectl -n kube-system get ds/kube-proxy` |
| kubeadm `podSubnet` == `IPPool` CIDR | otherwise the kubelet allocates pod IPs that Calico has not programmed | `grep POD_CIDR _out/cluster.env` → `10.244.0.0/16` |
| A host-only address on every node | source of Calico's address autodetection | `kubectl get nodes -o wide` → `INTERNAL-IP` in `192.168.56.x` |
| `kubectl` + `helm`, `KUBECONFIG` set | the script checks the binaries, then `/readyz` | `helm version` |

## ⚡ Install

> 🎓 **Two paths, same result**: the all-in-one script below, or the **"Guided
> walkthrough"** section further down — the same commands, one at a time, for training.

Through the repository entry point:
```bash
./install.sh <distro> calico     # <distro> = talos | kubeadm
```

```bash
./calico/calico-up.sh <distro>
```

Chart `projectcalico/tigera-operator` **`v3.32.1`** (repo `https://docs.tigera.io/calico/charts`),
pinned in the script via `CALICO_VERSION`. Idempotent (`helm upgrade --install` +
`kubectl apply`), safe to re-run.

Overridable variables:

| Variable | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `CALICO_VERSION` | `v3.32.1` | version of the chart **and** of Calico (the chart aligns them) |
| `NETWORK` | `NETWORK` from `lab.env`, else `192.168.56` | builds the host-only CIDR used by address autodetection |
| `POD_CIDR` | `POD_CIDR` from `_out/cluster.env`, else `lab.env`, else `10.244.0.0/16` | `IPPool` CIDR — must stay equal to the kubeadm `podSubnet` |
| `HOSTONLY_CIDR` | `${NETWORK}.0/24` | only touch it if your host-only network is not a `/24` |

## 🧬 Talos vs kubeadm

The `installation.yaml` manifest is **shared**, but two of its settings do not have the same
status on both distributions:

| Setting | Talos | kubeadm |
|---|---|---|
| `flexVolumePath: None` | **MANDATORY**: without it the operator mounts `/usr/libexec/kubernetes/…` as `DirectoryOrCreate`, and `/usr` is READ-ONLY ⇒ the `calico-node` pod never starts | pure slim-down (FlexVolume has been deprecated since K8s 1.23 and is unused here) |
| `kubeletVolumePluginPath: None` (CSI off) | **MANDATORY** (official Sidero guide "Deploy Calico CNI") | slim-down: one DaemonSet less per node |
| `privileged` PodSecurity labels on `tigera-operator` | **required** (cluster default `baseline`) | intent documentation (no level enforced) |
| Guardrail forbidding `KUBE_PROXY_REPLACEMENT=true` | moot (kube-proxy always installed) | **checked**: Calico does not replace kube-proxy |
| Where the cluster pod CIDR is read | `_out/controlplane.yaml` (`podSubnets`) | `_out/cluster.env` (`POD_CIDR`) |

Calico's eBPF dataplane stays off on both: it needs `bpfNetworkBootstrap` +
`FelixConfiguration`, and it is broken on some Talos releases (siderolabs/talos#12221). For
eBPF in this lab: use Cilium.

## 🎓 Guided walkthrough (step by step)

> The commands below are **exactly** what the all-in-one script does, in order.
> Set up your shell first (once per session):
> ```bash
> export KUBECONFIG=../Vagrant-Talos/kubeconfig        # or ../Vagrant-KubeADM/kubeconfig
> export LAB_DOMAIN=talos.lab.example.io               # or your own (see the lab's lab.env)
> ```

### 1. Guardrails (what the script checks before touching the cluster)

```bash
kubectl get nodes                                        # NotReady: expected, no CNI yet
kubectl get ds -A | grep -Ei 'cilium|flannel'            # must be EMPTY
kubectl -n kube-system get ds kube-proxy                 # MUST exist (Calico won't replace it)
```

### 2. Operator namespace (PodSecurity labels)

```bash
kubectl apply -f calico/namespace.yaml
kubectl get ns tigera-operator --show-labels
```

### 3. Tigera operator chart — all 4 chart CRs disabled

The chart ships no `crds/` directory: the operator creates the `operator.tigera.io` CRDs when
it starts. Any CR rendered by Helm would therefore fail on a fresh cluster ("no matches for
kind").

```bash
helm repo add projectcalico https://docs.tigera.io/calico/charts && helm repo update projectcalico
helm upgrade --install calico projectcalico/tigera-operator \
  --namespace tigera-operator --create-namespace \
  --version v3.32.1 \
  --set installation.enabled=false --set apiServer.enabled=false \
  --set goldmane.enabled=false --set whisker.enabled=false
kubectl -n tigera-operator rollout status deploy/tigera-operator --timeout=300s
```

### 4. Wait for the operator-created CRDs

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=Established crd/installations.operator.tigera.io --timeout=60s
kubectl wait --for=condition=Established crd/apiservers.operator.tigera.io  --timeout=60s
```

### 5. Apply the Installation + APIServer CRs

```bash
# The versioned CIDRs are the lab defaults: adjust if your lab.env differs
sed -e 's#192\.168\.56\.0/24#192.168.56.0/24#g' \
    -e 's#10\.244\.0\.0/16#10.244.0.0/16#g' \
    calico/installation.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl apply -f calico/apiserver.yaml
```

### 6. Wait for calico-node, then for the nodes

```bash
kubectl -n calico-system rollout status daemonset/calico-node --timeout=600s
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready nodes --all --timeout=300s
kubectl get tigerastatus
```

### 7. Verify — and understand what is MISSING

```bash
kubectl get ippools.projectcalico.org         # through the calico-apiserver, no calicoctl
kubectl -n envoy-gateway-system get svc       # EXTERNAL-IP <pending>: EXPECTED with Calico
```

> ⚠️ Calico announces no `LoadBalancer` Service IP (BGP only). `<pending>` at this exact point
> is therefore normal: it is [`../metallb/`](../metallb/README.md), installed by
> `platform-up.sh` right after this script, that fills the address in — see the 🌐 section.

## 🔧 What the script does

1. **Guardrails**: binaries, `/readyz`, refusal if another CNI is already there, refusal if
   kube-proxy is missing (`KUBE_PROXY_REPLACEMENT=true`), and refusal if `POD_CIDR` diverges from
   the `POD_CIDR` recorded in `_out/cluster.env`.
2. **[`namespace.yaml`](namespace.yaml)** — the `tigera-operator` namespace, created **before**
   the chart because it carries the PodSecurity `privileged` labels. Helm's `--create-namespace`
   sets no label. kubeadm enforces nothing cluster-wide by default, so this is insurance rather
   than a hard requirement — but it is what keeps the operator working on a hardened cluster
   (see ⚠️ Pitfalls).
3. **`tigera-operator` chart** in that namespace. The operator runs in `hostNetwork`: it starts
   **without a CNI**, which is what makes bootstrapping possible.
4. **Waits for the `operator.tigera.io` CRDs**: the operator is started with `-manage-crds=true`,
   so *it* is the one creating `installations` **and** `apiservers.operator.tigera.io`. Applying
   a CR before that fails with "no matches for kind …".
5. **`kubectl apply` of [`installation.yaml`](installation.yaml)**, with both CIDRs substituted
   on the fly (same mechanism as `LAB_DOMAIN` in `../platform-up.sh`), **then of
   [`apiserver.yaml`](apiserver.yaml)** which deploys the `calico-apiserver`.
6. **Bounded waits**: the `calico-system/calico-node` DaemonSet created, `rollout status`
   (600 s, the time of the first pull on 8 VMs), then all nodes `Ready` (300 s). Each one **fails
   with an error** carrying the diagnostic command to run — no `|| true` anywhere.
7. **Summary** + a yellow reminder of the two steps still missing for the lab UIs.

### The Helm settings that matter

The chart renders **four** custom resources (`Installation`, `APIServer`, `Goldmane`, `Whisker`)
and ships **no `crds/` directory** — the CRDs are created by the operator at runtime
(`-manage-crds=true`). So every one of them has to be disabled at install time, otherwise Helm
fails before it even creates the namespace:

```
Error: unable to build kubernetes objects from release manifest: resource mapping not found
for name: "default" ... no matches for kind "APIServer" in version "operator.tigera.io/v1"
ensure CRDs are installed first
```

| `--set` | Why |
|---|---|
| `installation.enabled=false` | the chart can generate the `Installation` CR itself; we pull it out into [`installation.yaml`](installation.yaml) to get **one** readable file and **one** owner of the object (not Helm *and* `kubectl apply`) |
| `apiServer.enabled=false` | same reason, CR moved to [`apiserver.yaml`](apiserver.yaml) and applied once the CRDs exist. The `calico-apiserver` **is** deployed: it exposes `projectcalico.org/v3` → Calico objects via `kubectl`, no `calicoctl` needed |
| `goldmane.enabled=false` + `whisker.enabled=false` | the flow aggregator + UI shipped by Calico 3.32, turned off to keep the lab light (VM RAM is counted, see `lab.env`). Turning them back on means extracting their CRs the same way — `--set goldmane.enabled=true` alone reintroduces the bootstrap failure above |

### The `installation.yaml` fields that matter

| Field | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `calicoNetwork.nodeAddressAutodetectionV4.cidrs` | `["192.168.56.0/24"]` | **THE key one**: forces the host-only address (see ⚠️ Pitfalls) |
| `ipPools[0].cidr` | `10.244.0.0/16` | identical to the kubeadm `podSubnet` |
| `ipPools[0].encapsulation` | `VXLAN` | unconditional encapsulation; `VXLANCrossSubnet` would fall back to direct routing between nodes of the same `/24`, which assumes the host-only switch forwards packets with a "pod" source IP — unverified. Same choice as flannel and Cilium |
| `calicoNetwork.bgp` | `Disabled` | no BGP peer on a host-only network ⇒ BIRD is useless (and therefore no service IP announcement) |
| `calicoNetwork.linuxDataplane` | `Iptables` | we keep the kube-proxy installed by `kubeadm init` — hence the mandatory `KUBE_PROXY_REPLACEMENT=false` |
| `calicoNetwork.mtu` | `1450` | 1500 (host-only) − 50 (IPv4 VXLAN headers) |
| `kubeletVolumePluginPath` | `None` | **lab slimming**: disables the Calico CSI driver (and its per-node `csi-node-driver` DaemonSet). It only serves flow-log ephemeral volumes, unused here |
| `flexVolumePath` | `None` | **lab slimming**: without it the operator adds a `flexvol-driver` init container mounting `/usr/libexec/kubernetes/kubelet-plugins/volume/exec/`. FlexVolume has been deprecated since Kubernetes 1.23 and only feeds Dikastes (L7 policy), unused here |

## ✅ Verify

```bash
kubectl -n tigera-operator get pods                       # tigera-operator Running
kubectl get tigerastatus                                  # calico / apiserver: AVAILABLE=True
kubectl -n calico-system get pods -o wide                 # one calico-node per node + typha
kubectl get nodes                                         # all Ready
kubectl get installation default -o yaml                  # the CR as the operator completed it
kubectl get ippools.projectcalico.org default-ipv4-ippool -o yaml   # cidr + vxlanMode Always
```

**The check that really matters**: the address picked by each node must be in `192.168.56.x`,
**never** `10.0.2.15`.

```bash
COLS='NODE:.metadata.name'
COLS="$COLS,ADDR:.metadata.annotations.projectcalico\.org/IPv4Address"
COLS="$COLS,VXLAN:.metadata.annotations.projectcalico\.org/IPv4VXLANTunnelAddr"
kubectl get nodes -o "custom-columns=$COLS"
```

Then a cross-node traffic test (this is where the NAT NIC pitfall shows up):

```bash
kubectl run t1 --image=busybox --restart=Never --command -- sleep 3600
kubectl run t2 --image=busybox --restart=Never --command -- sleep 3600
kubectl get pods -o wide                                  # check they are on 2 different nodes
kubectl exec t1 -- ping -c3 "$(kubectl get pod t2 -o jsonpath='{.status.podIP}')"
kubectl exec t1 -- nslookup kubernetes.default            # DNS = CoreDNS, often on another node
kubectl delete pod t1 t2
```

## 🌐 Making the lab UIs reachable (MetalLB)

Calico provides no `LoadBalancer` IP — but **you no longer have to do anything about it**. Both
steps that used to be manual are now handled by `../platform-up.sh` at step **[1/4]**, right
after this script, as soon as `CNI != cilium`:

**1. MetalLB is installed in L2 mode**, by [`../metallb/metallb-up.sh`](../metallb/README.md),
on the same range Cilium uses (`192.168.56.200` → `192.168.56.230`, with the **first IP** going
to `main-gateway`), on the same host-only interface and from the workers only. It reads the same
`LB_POOL_START` / `LB_POOL_END` / `HOSTONLY_IF` keys of `lab.env`, so the wildcard DNS record
keeps pointing at the same address whichever CNI you picked.

**2. The Cilium-specific `loadBalancerClass` is removed.**
[`../envoy-gateway/Envoy-Proxy.yml`](../envoy-gateway/Envoy-Proxy.yml) pins, on **line 13**:

```yaml
        loadBalancerClass: io.cilium/l2-announcer
```

`platform-up.sh` strips that line before applying the manifest when `CNI != cilium`.

> ⚠️ **It matters, and it is the #1 false lead here.** A `loadBalancerClass` tells Kubernetes
> "only this controller may handle this Service": left in place, MetalLB ignores the Service and
> the IP stays `<pending>` **even with a perfectly valid pool**. If you apply
> `Envoy-Proxy.yml` by hand rather than through `platform-up.sh`, delete the line yourself.

Result, with no extra step:

```bash
./platform-up.sh <distro>                                 # CNI=calico → Calico + MetalLB
kubectl -n envoy-gateway-system get svc                   # EXTERNAL-IP = 192.168.56.200
kubectl get servicel2status -A -o wide                    # which worker announces it
```

Installing it on its own — for a repair, or if you had opted out with `METALLB=false`:

```bash
./install.sh <distro> metallb
```

> ⚠️ **Never on a Cilium cluster.** Two announcers on one range means two nodes answering ARP
> for `.200`. `metallb-up.sh` refuses outright — see [`../metallb/README.md`](../metallb/README.md).

## ⚠️ Pitfalls

- **NAT NIC elected for the tunnels** — the house pitfall, see `CLAUDE.md`. Every VM has
  `enp0s3` (NAT, `10.0.2.15`, **the same IP on all VMs**, and the one carrying the default route)
  and `enp0s8` (host-only, `192.168.56.x`). Calico's default autodetection (`firstFound`) follows
  the default route ⇒ every node declares itself as `10.0.2.15`, every VXLAN VTEP points at an
  isolated NAT, and cross-node pod traffic + DNS are broken. Hence
  `nodeAddressAutodetectionV4.cidrs: ["192.168.56.0/24"]`. Same problem, same countermeasure as
  `--iface-can-reach` (flannel) and `devices=<host-only>` (Cilium).
- **A `baseline` PodSecurity level blocks the operator, and it fails SILENTLY.** The operator
  needs `hostNetwork` (that is what lets it start with no CNI at all) and a `/var/lib/calico`
  hostPath. kubeadm enforces **nothing** cluster-wide, so this does not bite out of the box — but
  it does on any cluster with a hardened default. `helm --create-namespace` sets no PSS label, so
  without [`namespace.yaml`](namespace.yaml) the `Deployment` would be created while the
  ReplicaSet cannot create a single pod. The trap is the symptom: `kubectl -n tigera-operator get
  pods` returns **nothing at all** — not a failing pod, zero pods — and the script dies on the
  `rollout status` timeout. The cause is only visible in the ReplicaSet events:
  `kubectl -n tigera-operator describe rs`. Same recipe as
  [`../observability/namespace.yaml`](../observability/namespace.yaml).
  > 💡 If you already hit the failure, fixing the labels is not enough: the ReplicaSet is in
  > exponential backoff and can idle past the 300 s timeout. Kick it with
  > `kubectl -n tigera-operator rollout restart deploy/tigera-operator`, then re-run the script.
- **`IPPool` CIDR ≠ kubeadm `podSubnet`** = silently broken pod network. The script refuses to
  continue if it detects the mismatch in `_out/cluster.env`, but if you change one, change the
  other.
- **Changing CNI is NOT a live switch.** Going from Cilium to Calico (or the other way round) on
  a live cluster leaves contradictory routes, iptables/eBPF rules and `/etc/cni/net.d` files. The
  procedure is: `./kubeadm/cluster-reset.sh` (or `vagrant destroy`) → `CNI=calico` in `lab.env`
  → `./kubeadm/cluster-up.sh` → `./calico/calico-up.sh`. The script's guardrail is there to
  stop you doing it by mistake, not to make the operation possible.
- **No Cilium `loadBalancerClass`**: see the 🌐 section above. It is the #1 cause of an
  `EXTERNAL-IP <pending>` that persists *after* MetalLB is installed — and it only bites when
  `Envoy-Proxy.yml` was applied by hand, since `platform-up.sh` strips the line for you.
- **eBPF dataplane: tempting, ruled out.** It would require `bpfNetworkBootstrap: Enabled`,
  `kubeProxyManagement: Enabled` and a `FelixConfiguration` (`cgroupV2Path`), and it would take
  over kube-proxy — exactly what `KUBE_PROXY_REPLACEMENT=false` says is *not* happening here.
  Too many moving parts for the lab's "comparison" CNI: if you want eBPF, take Cilium.
- **`kubectl delete -f installation.yaml` does not cleanly uninstall Calico**: the operator
  deletes `calico-node` and every node drops to `NotReady` at once, pods included. Use
  `helm uninstall` (see 🧹) or, better, destroy the lab.
- **MetalLB L2: a single node answers ARP per IP.** Like the `CiliumL2AnnouncementPolicy`, this
  is not load balancing: one speaker is elected per address, all the VIP traffic enters through
  that node, then kube-proxy spreads it. A speaker failover takes a few seconds (the time to
  re-ARP) — expected, not an incident.

## 🚑 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| The script fails on "another CNI is already installed" | you are re-running Calico on the lab's Cilium (or flannel) cluster | that is the guardrail: rebuild the cluster, no live switch |
| `helm` fails on `no matches for kind "APIServer"` / `ensure CRDs are installed first` | a chart CR is enabled while its CRD does not exist yet | keep the four CRs disabled (see the `--set` table); the CRs live in `installation.yaml` / `apiserver.yaml` |
| `rollout status` times out and `get pods` shows **zero** pod in `tigera-operator` | PodSecurity `baseline` rejects the operator (hostNetwork + hostPath) | `kubectl -n tigera-operator describe rs` to confirm, apply `namespace.yaml`, then `rollout restart` |
| CRD `installations.operator.tigera.io` never created | the operator cannot reach the apiserver, or never started | `kubectl -n tigera-operator logs deploy/tigera-operator` |
| `calico-node` in `Init:` / `CreateContainerConfigError` | a read-only hostPath (typically the `flexvol-driver` if `flexVolumePath` was dropped) | check `kubectl get installation default -o yaml` ⇒ `flexVolumePath: None` |
| Nodes `Ready` but DNS broken from a pod | NAT address elected for the tunnels | re-read the first ⚠️ Pitfalls bullet, then the annotations command in ✅ Verify |
| `kubectl get tigerastatus` → `Degraded` | the operator explains why in the message | `kubectl get tigerastatus calico -o yaml` |
| Gateway at `EXTERNAL-IP <pending>` | **expected** right after this script; a problem only once MetalLB has run | 🌐 section, then [`../metallb/README.md`](../metallb/README.md) |
| Pods `Pending` with `no IP addresses available in range` | the `/26` block on that node is exhausted, or the `IPPool` is too small | `kubectl get ipamblocks.crd.projectcalico.org` |

## 🧹 Uninstall

The chart ships a `pre-delete` hook (Job `tigera-operator-uninstall`) that cleans up the CR
before removing the operator:

```bash
helm uninstall calico -n tigera-operator
```

> ⚠️ **This cuts the CNI**: every node goes back to `NotReady` and the pod network disappears.
> Do not do it "just to see" on a lab that hosts anything. To get back to Cilium, destroy and
> rebuild the cluster (`./kubeadm/cluster-reset.sh` → `CNI=cilium` → `./kubeadm/cluster-up.sh`
> → `./platform-up.sh`).
